# Atlantic-Cyclone-Classification

This project uses Atlantic Cyclones information to predict Cyclone types, I trained and evaludated 3 models, KNN, Deciscion Tree and Random Forest to see which model is most suitable for my purpose. 

## Context

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) conducts a post-storm analysis of each tropical cyclone in the Atlantic
basin (i.e., North Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea) and and the North Pacific Ocean to determine the official assessment of the cyclone's history. This analysis makes use of all available observations, including those that may not have been available in real time. In addition, NHC conducts ongoing reviews of any retrospective tropical cyclone analyses brought to its attention and on a regular basis updates the historical record to reflect
changes introduced.

## Content

The NHC publishes the tropical cyclone historical database in a format known as HURDAT, short for HURricane DATabase. These databases (Atlantic HURDAT2 and NE/NC Pacific HURDAT2) contain six-hourly information on the location, maximum winds, central pressure, and (starting in 2004) size of all known tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones.
